# Algorithm Efficiency Mini Project

## Overview
This project analyzes and visualizes the efficiency of **recursive and iterative algorithms**.  
We implemented **7 algorithms** (Fibonacci Recursive & DP, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Binary Search) and compared their **time and space complexity** through experiments.

The goal is to **understand algorithm trade-offs** and visualize their performance across different input sizes.

## Features
- Implementations of classic algorithms in Python  
- Time and memory profiling using `time` and `memory_profiler`  
- Visualization with `matplotlib`  
- Comparative analysis of algorithms
