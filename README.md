# Algorithm Efficiency Mini Project

## Overview
This project analyzes and visualizes the efficiency of **recursive and iterative algorithms**.  
We implemented the following algorithms in Python and studied their **time and space complexity** with practical profiling and visualization:

- Fibonacci (Recursive & Dynamic Programming)  
- Merge Sort  
- Quick Sort  
- Insertion Sort  
- Bubble Sort  
- Selection Sort  
- Binary Search  

The notebook demonstrates **execution time growth with input size** and explains **trade-offs between algorithms**.
